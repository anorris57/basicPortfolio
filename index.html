           I am currently taking the Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp. I am looking forward to learning about <br> the various languges. I have been interested in computers since I took my first computer class <br> in college. During my time teaching Chemistry I embraced new technology as it came <br> out. I learned to give on line assessments which stream lined the grading and feedback process.<br>  My last school was a google school and I learned much about the Google suite of <br> apps for education. I routinely used google sheets, presentations, forms, drive, and others. <br> I was increasingly becoming more interested in the story behind the innovations. <br> Finally I decided to make the jump especially since GT started this local program.
